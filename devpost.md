## Inspiration

Our group, being rave and concert goers,  was initially inspired by the laser and light shows delivered at such events. It seemed quite apparent anecdotally, and in the widespread adoption of accompanying visual spectacles, that an auditory experience can be synergistically enhanced by engaging other human senses, especially sight.

As such we thought about the health implications of such a technology. It is widely understood and researched that music has a role in pain management (1), and mental wellbeing (2). These findings are ubiquitous within (3)  and without (4) healthcare settings, and non-discriminating by age (5, 6). 

One area of implementation is the use in paediatric functional constipation which is a common ailment with significant impact on the affected child and their parents (7). An aspect of this disease we hope to improve through MusicViz is to reduce the anxiety and pain associated with the toilet for children (8) by enhancing music therapy with accompanying visual stimuli. 

## What it does

Existing audio visualising technologies seem to only decompose music and sounds into a composition of frequencies and visualise audio in a frequency-amplitude domain. What we hope to achieve with MusicViz is to gain a deeper insight into music through Neuro-Linguistic Programming and music analysis to extract its characteristics.

MusicViz would be attempting to extract the technical components of a piece such as its keys and key changes, tempo and rhythm, chords, consonances and dissonances. Combined with analysis of melody, lyrics to provide more insight into more nuanced and complex concepts such as the themes, mood, tension and release of the piece. Then based on its analysis, produce a synchronised visual representation of the piece in the form of an LED light show. 

## How we built it



## Challenges we ran into



## Accomplishments that we're proud of



## What we learned



## What's next for MusicVis

Currently MusicVis does this by preprocessing a musical piece but the hope in the future is that it would be able to perform this as close to realtime as possible and extrapolate to more sophisticated lighting systems.

An additional function we would really like to develop would be the capabilities to integrate the user's live environment and mood to make appropriate musical choices on their behalf to enhance a user's experience.
